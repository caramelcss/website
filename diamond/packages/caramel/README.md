> Caramel is a simple, modern, responsive website framework. Caramel is fully responsive, meaning you only need to write code once, to have the same results across multiple platforms. Created by [kurisubrooks](https://kurisubrooks.com), Caramel is being developed with help from the open-source community on GitHub.

## Getting Started
- [Download the latest Release](https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel/releases)
- [Download the latest Development Build](https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel.git```

#### Quick Start
Jump right into Caramel by using the following HTML5 Boilerplate.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Caramel</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link href="./caramel.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

    <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Caramel!</h1>
        <p>Your code goes down here!</p>
    </main>

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./caramel.min.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

## What's included?
Our [public releases](https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel/releases) only contain the files that are necessary for front-end development. If you'd like to develop for, or modify Caramel, we'd recommend downloading the [Development Build](https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel/archive/master.zip), which includes our build tool, and the sass source files.

## Compiling
We've included an easy and hassle free way for you to compile Caramel. We've included our own Gulp build tool, that you can use to compile Caramel.

#### Required:
Our compiler runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed.
Once you have Node installed, you'll need [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). If you already have both Node and Gulp installed, skip these steps, otherwise install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from their website, then run the following command to install Gulp:
```
npm install gulp --global
```
**Note: You may need to run this command with sudo on macOS**

#### Install:
To get the latest version of Caramel and to install the build tools, run the following set of commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/caramelcss/caramel.git
cd ./caramel
npm install
```

#### Usage:
To run the build tool, run the following command:
```
gulp
```

After the build is complete, the output `caramel.css`, `caramel.min.css` and `caramel.min.js` files can be found in your `./dist/css` and `./dist/js` folders respectively.

## Compatibility
Caramel has been designed for any browser that supports [CSS3](https://html5test.com/). Caramel has been tested, and is recommended for use on:

Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Opera | Edge | IE
:----: | :-----: | :----: | :---: | :--: | :-:
  21+  |   28+   |   7+   | 12.1+ |  20+ | 10, 11
