<h1 class="title">Usage</h1>

Caramel makes use of both CSS3 and JavaScript to bring you the best experience possible. Both files, `caramel.css` and `caramel.js` are required for caramel to function correctly. Caramel can run without the js file being included, but you may find that navigation and buttons may not work as expected. On top of this, jQuery is also required for caramel to function.

We've provided a few ways for you to install Caramel, so you can choose whichever option suits your own workflow.

#### 1. Install with Diamond (Recommended)
```bash
diamond install caramel
```

<br>

#### 2. Install with NPM

Caramel requires the use of jQuery for JavaScript purposes. We recommend aquiring it from a CDN, such as cdnjs. Add the following line of code before the line where you import `caramel.js`:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

<br>

Additionally, if you'd like to use Font Awesome with Caramel, you can do so by adding the following line to either the `<head>` section, or at the end of the `<body>` section:
```html
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
